In this tutorial, we'll be using Angular 18, the latest version of Angular, the popular platform for building front-end web applications with TypeScript. The latest version, released on May 22, brings a set of new features and enhancements that we will leverage to build a robust movies application.

We'll be building a movie application with Angular 18 and API, showcasing different concepts such as working with standalone components, services, consuming a REST API with HttpClient, Observables and infinite scrolling and playing videos. We'll also cover the use of the async pipe and various other pipes like the date and currency pipes. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to build dynamic and interactive web applications using Angular 18. We'll also be using Tailwind CSS for styling our UI.

Our Angular 18 application will have the following features:

1. **Three pages**: Home, Movies and Show Movie pages. 
2. **Navbar and footer standalone components.**
3. **Three sections for movies**: Popular, Top Rated, and Now Playing.
4. **Image slider**: A movies slider.
5. **Scrolling functionality**: Buttons to navigate through movie lists.
6. **Movie cards**: Each movie will be displayed in a card format containing the title, release date, and rating.
7.  **API Integration**: Get movie data from an external API.
8.  **Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive user interface using Tailwind CSS.
9. **Infinite scrolling.**
